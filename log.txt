-> from the idea first come in mind (may be in August 2011) to the september 2011.
	
	- Calender generate script
	- study this script
	- how to get Date from that script


-> in Octomber 2011	
	
	- arrange this string in desired format
	- convert it into the url
	- find the day of selected day (it took so much time :) )
	- only for sunday and wednesday

	- deployed on herokuapp.com cloud service
	- download the tool on Home basic for git upload and all(read deploymentproblem)
	

-> 29/11/2011

	- From last two days I was trying different options like googlesites,dropbox etc,and today suddenly I just tried 		  to run old app without any changes and it works fine.Unbelivable...ureka... :) [Though notinh is magic this 		  means it'll take time to take chammges take place on heroku server and than on fb's server.] 

-> 30/11/2011

	- worked on UI,add some steps and all
	- adjust the position of button,textbox and calender control

-> 01/12/2011

	- the functionality related TO DO 1 (bug#1) has been done now it's working fine when user selects a single 		  character date.i.e 6th oct 2011. :)

-> 03/12/2011

	- bug#2 found and fixed.. :)





# TO DO:

*Deployment related:

-/ try to study fb code,and depoly the app one by one.

	- first try for calender only without form tag.

-/ If first one doesn't work than go for google sites for web hosting.

-/ Try to decorate the page.

-/ Remove un-necessary built-in code.

- Try to learn more about fb app settings and how to use fb app more effectively


*Functionality related:

1-/ bug#1: add 0 when the single date selected e.g on selection of 6th oct 2011 it converts the
  	   gurl string like 2011116,it should be 20111106.

2-/ bug#2: When month has only one digit than it will create problem e.g any date from the month of February in 2011 is 	   not working properly
